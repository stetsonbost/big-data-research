# Research Log

This is a log of my progress for my big data research with Professor Weiqing Gu at Harvey Mudd College during Summer 2017.

## Tuesday, May 16
TFor this research, it is essential that I (re)learn core concepts of big data. As such, I am spending the first part of the research studying these. 

Today I set up my account on the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center (PSC) server for the XSEDE big data workshop that is taking place on Thursday and Friday. I also looked at the main slides they will be using on Thursday ([Intro to Big Data](https://www.psc.edu/images/xsedetraining/BigDataFebruary2017/Intro_To_Big_Data.pdf), [Hadoop](https://www.psc.edu/images/xsedetraining/BigDataFebruary2017/BigData_Hadoop_110116.pdf), and [Spark](https://www.psc.edu/images/xsedetraining/BigDataFebruary2017/BigData_Hadoop_110116.pdf)). While these gave me a good idea of what would be covered in the workshop, it's obvious that it will be a very hands-on workshop that will teach me how to use popular computational tools like Hadoop and Spark for big data analytics.

In addition to preparing for the workshop, I also started studying material from Andrew Ng's course [CS 229: Machine Learning](http://cs229.stanford.edu/materials.html), taught at Stanford.
